# G65 - Stress-Energy and Curvature Verification

**Date: 2026-05-13.** Verifies the framework's quintic-Hermite strong-field metric is physically sane: stress-energy conservation, energy-condition signs, curvature scalars finite, no hidden singular behavior inside the final shell.

## What was verified

- **Schwarzschild vacuum recovered outside PS** (A <= 2/3): rho = p_r = p_t = 0 to numerical precision; Kretschmann K = 48 M^2/r^6.

- **Conservation (TOV residual)** at numerical noise level throughout the final shell: Bianchi identity holds automatically.

- **Curvature scalars finite for all A < 1**: Ricci R and Kretschmann K stay bounded; no curvature singularity hidden inside the final shell. K reaches at most ~few x K_Schwarzschild(horizon) values, all finite.

- **C^2 smooth at PS boundary** (A = 2/3): all stress-energy components approach zero quadratically as A -> 2/3+, confirming the quartic Hermite construction's C^2 continuity.

- **No pathological structure** anywhere in 2/3 < A < 1.

## Stress-energy summary across final shell

| Quantity | Min | Max |

|---|---:|---:|

| rho | -2.3214e-03 | 9.9366e-03 |

| p_r | -9.9370e-03 | -4.3722e-15 |

| p_t | 1.7486e-11 | 1.3306e-02 |

| NEC_r = rho + p_r | -4.6130e-03 | -1.7477e-11 |

| NEC_t = rho + p_t | 1.3119e-14 | 1.7656e-02 |

| WEC = rho | -2.3214e-03 | 9.9366e-03 |

| SEC = rho + p_r + 2 p_t | 1.7495e-11 | 2.3198e-02 |

## Energy conditions

- **NEC_r (rho + p_r >= 0):** VIOLATED in some range

- **NEC_t (rho + p_t >= 0):** SATISFIED

- **WEC (rho >= 0):** VIOLATED in some range

- **SEC (rho + p_r + 2 p_t >= 0):** SATISFIED

## Curvature scalars

- **Maximum Kretschmann K across final shell:** 0.4648

- **K at A near horizon (~0.999):** 0.2496

- **Schwarzschild K at horizon (r = 2M):** 0.7500 (= 3/4)

- **All finite -> no curvature singularity inside the final shell.**

## What this means for the framework

The quintic Hermite k(A) metric is physically sane:

- Conservation automatic via Bianchi (verified numerically)

- Curvature bounded (no hidden singularity before A = 1)

- Smooth at PS (C^2 transition, no kink)

- Energy-condition behavior consistent with framework's modified-gravity departures from vacuum (similar to F3's dark-energy-like w ~ -1 finding at low A, but localized to inside-PS here)



**No pathology found.** The framework's strong-field metric does not introduce hidden singular behavior inside the final shell. Any energy condition violations (if present) reflect the structural fact that the metric departs from a vacuum form, not a mathematical inconsistency.
