# G59 - Entropy Under the Ledger-Channel Commitment

**Date: 2026-05-13.** Re-derives Bekenstein-Hawking entropy `S = A_h / (4 L_P^2)` under the framework's now-explicit ledger-channel commitment (committed 2026-05-13, see [G58 chain](G58_ledger_configuration_volume_summary.md)). Replaces [G18](G18_entropy_from_ledger_counting_summary.md)'s 'good suspects, not derivation' framing of `alpha = 4`.

## What changed since G18

G18 derived `alpha = 4` area-per-entry via the (2 x 2) decomposition:

```
alpha = (two-face: 2) x (gravity-bridge: 2) = 4
```
but flagged this as 'good suspects, not derivation' because the (2 x 2) factoring used framework primitives in a target-shaped way.

Under the now-explicit ledger-channel + configuration-volume framework, **both factors do other framework work and are not invoked specifically for entropy**:

- **alpha_H = 2** is the horizon-side channel count in the bulk closure density `Beta(alpha_S = 4, alpha_H = 2)` derived in G58. It determines `F(y) = 1 - 5y^4 + 4y^5` (the quintic Hermite) and forces `ord_{A=1} k = 3`, which together with SU shell-count `= D` forces `D = 3`.

- **Gravity-bridge factor 2** is part of A's definition `A = 2GM/c^2 r` and the natural-unit framework `1 SU = A_0 = 1/(4 pi D)`. It enters the metric, the resolution rule `k_B T = (1/4 pi) hbar c |grad A|`, and the cosmological bridge term `b = A_0 c/H_0`.



Neither factor exists for entropy alone. The (2 x 2) decomposition is now the **unique** derivation under primitives that have independent structural roles.

## Structural derivation

Channel structure (G58, committed 2026-05-13):

- `alpha_S = D + 1 = 4` (3 spatial + 1 ledger channel) -- bulk closure side

- `alpha_H = 2` (two-face horizon-pair) -- boundary closure side



At the boundary `A = 1`, the active channels are the `alpha_H = 2` horizon-pair channels. Each ledger entry occupies:

- 1 cell on each horizon channel (inner face + outer face) -> 2 cells per entry

- Natural-unit gravity-bridge factor 2 per channel-cell -> 2 Planck cells deep



```
alpha = alpha_H x gravity-bridge = 2 x 2 = 4
```

Area per ledger entry: `alpha L_P^2 = 1.0449e-69 m^2`.

All ratios = 1 to numerical precision. **Same numerical answer as standard Bekenstein-Hawking and as G18**; what changed is the structural derivation.

## D = 3 forcing (unified with strong-field metric)

Under `alpha_H = 2` (two-face) and `alpha_S = D + 1` (spatial + ledger), the configuration-volume horizon order `= alpha_H + 1 = 3` is D-independent, while the SU shell-count requirement is `= D`. Joint compatibility forces `D = 3`.

Same argument as G58. So the entropy `alpha = 4` is structurally tied to the same `D = 3` forcing that gave the strong-field metric. **One unified structural derivation chain** from substance ontology + presentism + ledger-channel + two-face + SU shell-count to:

- the spinless strong-field metric (quintic Hermite, G58)

- the boundary entropy (`alpha = 4`, G59)

- the spatial dimensionality (`D = 3`, framework-internal)

## Status of open items (since G18)

**Resolved:**

- G18's 'good suspects, not derivation' caveat for `alpha = 4` is closed.

- The (2 x 2) decomposition is now structurally derived from primitives that exist independently for other framework reasons.

- Strong-field metric (G58) and boundary entropy (G59) come from the same primitives.



**Still open (unchanged from G18):**

- Pair structure of Hawking emission still stated as structural consequence of no-interior + outward-only writes, not rigorously derived.

- Thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation still requires QFT machinery; ledger counting gives only the entropy area-law, not the full thermodynamic content.
