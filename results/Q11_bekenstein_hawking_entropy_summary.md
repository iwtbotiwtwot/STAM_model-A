# STAM Model-A Q11: Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy from the Bubble Picture

## Purpose

Derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy `S = k_B A / (4 ell_P^2)` for a black hole, from STAM-native ingredients: the bold-STAM bubble picture (no interior, all matter on the 2D phase boundary) and the Q10 phase-boundary temperature.

## Two derivations, same answer

### Path A — physical reason (bubble picture)

In bold STAM, A=1 is a 2D phase boundary between spacetime and not-spacetime. All matter that ever fell toward the black hole is on the boundary surface; there is no interior. So:
- **No volume to fill.** The black hole has no 3D bulk for degrees of freedom to live in. Whatever entropy the system holds is on the 2D surface.
- **Area scaling is automatic.** Entropy is proportional to area because area is the only place degrees of freedom can be.
- **The 1/4 prefactor follows from holographic-bound saturation.** A 2D phase boundary with no interior cannot hold less entropy than the holographic bound; with no interior to share with, it must saturate the bound. The bound is `S <= k_B A / (4 ell_P^2)`, so saturation gives `S = k_B A / (4 ell_P^2)`.

Author's plain-language statement: *area scaling because that's where everything is*. That sentence is the physical content of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.

### Path B — quantitative (first law + Q10 temperature)

Apply the first law of thermodynamics `dE = T dS` to a black hole, with E = M c^2 and T from Q10:
```text
T_Q10 = hbar c |grad A| / (4 pi k_B)                     [Q8 / Q10 result]
      = hbar c / (4 pi k_B Rs)                           [|grad A| = 1/Rs at horizon]

dE = T dS  ->  dS = c^2 dM / T
             = c^2 dM * 4 pi k_B Rs / (hbar c)
             = 4 pi k_B c Rs / hbar  dM
             = 8 pi k_B G M / (hbar c)  dM     [Rs = 2GM/c^2]

Integrate from 0 to M:
S(M) = 4 pi k_B G M^2 / (hbar c)

Substitute A = 4 pi Rs^2 = 16 pi G^2 M^2 / c^4:
S = k_B c^3 A / (4 hbar G)
  = k_B A / (4 ell_P^2)                        [ell_P^2 = hbar G / c^3]
```
This is exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The 1/4 came out of the integration; it was not put in.

## Where the 1/4 actually comes from

The 1/4 in `S = A / 4` is the same structural factor as the 1/(4 pi) in the temperature `T = hbar c |grad A| / (4 pi)`. Both originate from the STAM gravity bridge `g = (c^2 / 2) grad A`, which contains the c^2/2 that propagates through to 1/(2*2) = 1/4 in the entropy and 1/(2*2 pi) = 1/(4 pi) in the temperature.

When the first-law integration is done, the 2 pi from the temperature combines with the 2 pi from the horizon area (A = 4 pi Rs^2) to give a factor of 8 pi in dS/dM, and the integration brings in another 1/2 (since integral of M dM = M^2/2), giving 4 pi G k_B / (hbar c) * M^2. Re-expressed in terms of A, the prefactor is 1/4.

**Reading the table:** `S_STAM / S_BH = 1.0` and `(S in natural units) / (A / 4) = 1.0` across all mass scales. Bold STAM reproduces Bekenstein-Hawking entropy exactly. The numerical integral matches the closed-form result, confirming the integration was done correctly.

## What this gives bold STAM

Bold STAM now has a complete black hole thermodynamics chain:
1. **Temperature** `T = hbar c |grad A| / (4 pi k_B)` — Q8 postulate, Q10 derivation.
2. **Spectrum** Planckian at T — Q10 derivation (Bose-Einstein on equilibrated phase boundary).
3. **Entropy** `S = k_B A / (4 ell_P^2)` — Q11 derivation (bubble picture + first law).
4. **Energy bookkeeping** dE = T dS — first law, used in Q11.

All four are reproduced exactly relative to standard Hawking results, but for different physical reasons: phase-boundary equilibrium and bubble surface, not Schwarzschild Wick rotation and QFT mode counting.

**For the README:** entropy and thermodynamic-consistency status now move from open to derived. Bold STAM has a closed-form BH thermodynamics that matches the standard results numerically while having a fundamentally different mechanism (no interior, phase boundary as the only source of degrees of freedom).
